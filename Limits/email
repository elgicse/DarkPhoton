Dear all,

I am a PhD student in the Zurich group working on SHiP, and I started studying the sensitivity to dark photons.
In the attachment you can see my preliminary result. Only proton bremsstrahlung is considered as production mode. As a cross-check, I tested my toy software on a few points that should lie on the sensitivity limit for the Nu-Cal1 experiment, and found a good agreement. We will make more cross-checks.
I am now starting to work on the other production channels (meson decays), I will keep you informed.

If needed, I can produce ntuples of dark photons and their decay products within the acceptance of the experiment.

If you have any comment or remark I would be glad of discussing them with you.

Best regards,

Elena Graverini
